## Briefly about myself

I like to solve interesting problems, try to find elegant solutions. In programming, i found this. Programming allows me to hone this skill endlessly, develops my brain and makes my life rich and interesting. I like to study different programming paradigms by looking at how they are implemented in programming languages, such as: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Haskell and others.
